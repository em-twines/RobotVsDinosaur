#(10 points): As a developer, I want a Dinosaur to have the ability to attack a Robot on a Battlefield. 
# This attack method should lower a Robot’s health by the value of the Dinosaur’s attack_power. 

from robot import Robot

    def __init__ (self, attack_power):
        self.name = ""
        self.attack_power = attack_power
        self.health = int

        robot = Robot()
